# sourceful-assignment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Improvements Implemented

### Mobile Dialog - Selected State Indicator
The mobile category selection dialog displays the currently selected category with visual highlighting, allowing users to see their active selection while browsing all available options. This improves user awareness and provides clear context when choosing a new category.

### Responsive Dialog Visibility Fix
Fixed an issue where the mobile dialog would remain visible when resizing from mobile to desktop view. The dialog now properly hides when switching to desktop breakpoint, ensuring clean transitions between mobile and desktop interfaces.

### Carousel Navigation Button Visibility
Implemented proper scroll navigation button visibility logic. The left navigation button now disappears when at the leftmost position, and the right navigation button disappears when at the rightmost position. This provides intuitive visual feedback about scroll boundaries and prevents unnecessary interaction with disabled navigation controls.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
